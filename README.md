A brainstorming space for examining SRP in the controller layer.

## Conventions

Controllers are namespaced and located within the Controllers/ folder
The domain model is namespaced and located within a folder matching the top-level namespace.
Resources is a folder that contains things such as config/ views/ migrations/ etc

more.. everything is just a proposed idea designed for enabling conversation. This is a constant WIP.
